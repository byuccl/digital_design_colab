    "Think about a vending machine. It waits for someone to approach. It then waits for you to enter the code for the snack you want. Then it takes your money from you for the snack. Then it gives you the snack. It also has to be ready in case the user cancels their choice, takes too long or messes up the payment, and then it resets and waits for new instructions.\n",

    "This type of machine is called a state machine. Each mode of the machine is called a state. The state machine can remember which state it is in and will transition to a different state when certain conditions are met. The state machine does specific actions based on what state it is in. The two important parts of a state machine are the actions and transitions. Actions are things that happen in a state and transitions are the conditions necessary to change states.\n",

By representing your design with a state graph, it is easy to visualize its functionality and also find potential problems. Once your state graph is complete, it is easy to take the next step and move from a state graph to coding the hardware implementation in SystemVerilog."

    "An important aspect of state machines is outputs. Outputs, also called actions, are how the machine interacts with the world around it. For example, you could have a yellow LED light up while it is in the \"Waiting for Payment\" state, and a green LED light up while it is in the \"Dispensing Food\" state. Outputs also include everything the state machine does, including dispensing the food. But some outputs shouldn't depend only on the state. You could have a noise that plays when the machine switches to the \"Entering a choice\" state, but you wouldn't want it to play the whole time someone is making their decision. You could make the output dependent on a stop signal from a timer in addition to the state that this is in, or maybe it only occurs on the transition.\n",

    "The LED outputs mentioned are known as Moore outputs. A Moore output is dependent only on the current state, and ignores all other signals. The sound output is an example of a Mealy output. Mealy outputs are dependent on the current state and another signal. These are often high as the state machine switches states. Because of this, Mealy outputs will be written next to transition lines on the State Graph, and Moore outputs will be written next to the state it is dependent on. "

    "### Potential Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some potential issues to be aware of when creating a state machine. There are two cases which can create bad state machines. These are incomplete and conflicting states. Take look at the transitions out of state A in the following graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuccl/digital_design_colab/master/Exercises/state_machines/media/StateGrapeTypes.drawio.svg\"\n",
    "width=\"2000\" height=\"340\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto \" />\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicting State:\n",
    "Conflicting states occur when the condition for two different transistions from a state can occur at the same time. In the first example, when in state A, if X and Y are both high, the machine is expected go to both state B and C, which is not possible. The exact response of a bad statemachine in this situtation depends on the machines implementation. However, this issue can be avoided by ensuring that there is no overlap in conditions. To avoid the conflict, you must choose what happens when both independant conditions are high. For example, you may choose to always transition to B when X is high and then only transition to C when Y is high and X is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incomplete State:\n",
    "Incomplete States occur when the state machine does not specify transitions for all possible inputs. For instance, the first graph does not indicate what happens in state A if both X and Y are low. Often the absence of a transition in a graph implies that the remaining conditions result in the state machine remaining in that state. However, for a graph to be complete, those transitions should be explicitly displayed. When implementing a state machine, you should ensure that all possible conditions have a defined behavior of either transitioning to a new state or remaining in the current state. \n",
    "To check for incomplete states, you can create a truth table of all possible values and make sure each has an outcome. An easy solution when coding to avoid incomplete states is to use an else statement that sets the next state as the current state.\n",

    "### Coding State Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets talk about how to implement a state machine using RTL. \n",
    "\n",
    "The state: How will your code know which state you are in? You could assign each state an integer value and store that value, but that can get complicated as it will be hard to tell which state is which.  \n",
    "You can instead offload this work to the compiler. By using `typedef enum` we can define the states for the state machine.  \n",
    "Example: `typedef enum logic [1:0] {StateOne, StateTwo, StateThree} statetype;`\n",
    "    Each state will be translated into a binary value. Make sure your state type is wide enough that each one can be represented.  \n",
    "    The last word `statetype` is the new name of the type. So if you wanted to make another state variable you would use `statetype MyNewStateType;`  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So now you have the variable storing your state, what should we do with it?  \n",
    "Well we want the behavior to change depending on the state.  \n",
    "For this we can use a `switch` statement. Different code will execute depending on the code. \n",
    "```\n",
    "case(myStateType):\n",
    "    StateOne: begin\n",
    "    end\n",
    "    State Two: begin\n",
    "    end\n",
    "    StateThree: begin\n",
    "    end\n",
    "endcase;\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will put this in an `always_comb` block. But now how will we handle updating the state?   \n",
    "We will use an `always_ff` block along with a `nextState` variable. This is because the `currentState` variable needs to be a flip-flop in order to store the value. In our `always_comb` block we will set `nextState` to the correct value depending on `currentState` and any other factors. Then in the `always_ff` block we will simply set `currentState<=nextState`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "//There is an input button\n",
    "typedef enum logic [1:0] {IDLE, ONE_SHOT, WAIT} stateType;\n",
    "logic pressed;\n",
    "statetype currentState, nextState;\n",
    "\n",
    "always_comb begin\n",
    "    output = 1'b0; //The default case of Output. Prevents latches\n",
    "    case(currentState)\n",
    "        IDLE: begin\n",
    "            if(button) //If the button is pressed, activate the oneshot, else wait\n",
    "                nextState = ONE_SHOT;\n",
    "            else\n",
    "                nextState = WAIT;\n",
    "        end\n",
    "        ONE_SHOT: begin //If the button has been pressed, set the output high for one clock cycle\n",
    "            nextState = WAIT;\n",
    "            output = 1'b1;\n",
    "        end\n",
    "        WAIT: begin //Wait for teh button to be released\n",
    "            if(button)\n",
    "                nextState = WAIT;\n",
    "            else\n",
    "                nextState = IDLE;\n",
    "        end\n",
    "    endcase\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "always_ff @(posedge clk) begin\n",
    "    currentState <= nextState; //Update the state\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a simple One Shot. It takes in a signal as an input (usually a button) and has it only be high for one cycle. This is quite useful for buttons to make sure it only registers one press each time you press it, and not a lot of presses. This is useful for things like a counter, that increments each type you press a button. You don't want a press and hold to register as thousands of presses.\n",
