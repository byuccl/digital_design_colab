        "After learning about boolean algerba you might be thinking: \"That's kind of interesting, but how is this useful?\" The trick is that you can implement boolean logic in hardware to help computers make decisions. You do this with logic gates. A simple logic gate will have 2 inputs, and 1 output. These inputs and outputs represent digital signals. The signals can either be high or low. High means that the signal has a positive voltage. This is represented as a 1, and is the same as \"true\" when using boolean logic. Low means that the signal has not voltage. This can be represented as a 0, or \"false\" when using bolean logic. When you put a bunch of these gates together is strategic ways, you can create complex systems that make up computers."
