        "After learning about boolean algebra, it's time to see how we can actually use it in computers. You can use logic gates to implement boolean logic in hardware to help computers make decisions. A simple logic gate will have 2 inputs, and 1 output. These inputs and outputs represent digital signals. The signals can either be high or low. High means that the signal has a positive voltage. This is represented as a 1, and is the same as \"true\" when using boolean logic. Low means that the signal has no voltage. This can be represented as a 0, or \"false\" when using bolean logic. When you combine many of these gates in strategic ways, you can create the complex systems that make up computers."
