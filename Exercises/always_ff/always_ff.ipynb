    "\n",
    "Frequency is the number of times something occurs in a given time frame, while period is the amount of time it takes for something to occur. They are inverses of one another. $Period = \\frac{1}{Frequency}$ and $Frequency = \\frac{1}{Period}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important when dealing with Clocks in circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "You are running around a pillar while \n",
    "playing tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "You run around it 3 times every minute. That is your frequency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The period would be $\\frac{1}{Frequency}$, so every 1/3 of a minute or 20 seconds you would complete a circle. This is the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So why does Frequency and Period matter?    \n",
    "\n",
    "Timing is very important because of the FPGAs built in clock. The clock keeps all elements in the circuit working together and prevents conflicts.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, inorder to create a stopwatch, you will need to know how many clock cycles occur in a given time frame, then after counting that many, increment the stopwatch."

    "Instead of using `always_comb` blocks we will now use a `always_ff` block. The standard is `always_ff @(posedge clk)`  \n",
