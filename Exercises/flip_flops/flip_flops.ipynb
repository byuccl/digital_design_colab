    "The clock is used in making sure all parts of the circuit are synchronized. We have only been working with combination logic which doesn't require a clock, but now we will discuss sequential logic. \n",

Reset can be used to make the circuit go low and stay there. The value of `Q` stores a bit. There is also always a `Q'` value. Though this has some problems, if `S` is `0` this does not cause `Q` to be `0`. Also if `S` and `R` are high, the behavior is unknown.  \n",

    "We can replace the `R` signal with an inverter attached to `S`, which we will now call `D`.  This makes a Gated D Latch which looks like this. Whenver `clk` is high, `Q` will become whatever `D` is. This fixes the earlier problem, where if `R` and `S` were the same they would cause undefined behavior, because they will always be different.\n",

    "Gated D Latches are so common this symbol is used to represent it. There is a small problem though, if `D` is changed to quickly, it can cause a race. The signal will rush from `D` and split. The two different paths will race each other. It is unknown which path will win, especially since the `clk` signal will turn quickly after. This means that we don't know what the value of `Q` will be, which isn't good.\n",

This results in a latch where the output only changes on the rising edge (when the CLK goes from low to high) of falling edge (where the CLK goes from high to low) of the CLK signal. \n"
