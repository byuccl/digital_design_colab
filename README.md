# Notebooks 2.0<br>

This repository contains [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) pages for learning about and developing digital circuits.
This repository contains colab examples for:

* [Tutorials](./Tutorials/README.md)
* [Learning Exercises](./Exercises/README.md)
* [Design Labs](./Labs/README.md)

Explanations about each type of Notebook can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/byuccl/digital_design_colab2/wiki).
If you're new to this repository and are looking for a place to start, [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/byuccl/digital_design_colab2/blob/master/Tutorials/notebook_functionality/notebook_functionality.ipynb) explains what you need to know about Google Colabs in order to follow along with the rest of the notebooks.
