        "Verilator is an open source tool that is used in this set of notebooks. We use verilator to simulate your SystemVerilog designs. It is important to simulate hardware designs before trying to implement them fully on the hardware. It can be difficult to understand potential issues with your design when running on hardware since many signals are not visible. Simulating your design through Verilator will allow you to see each of the signals down to every nano second. To accomplish this simulation process, Verilator converts SystemVerilog (HDL) designs into a C++ model that, after compiling, can be executed. We use Veriltor in 3 main ways: linting, simulation, and test benches.\n",

This will catch syntax errors and other errors in your code before it tries to convert it to C++. If there are bugs when you try to simulate your SystemVerilog code, Verilator will print out a message to help you correct it.\n",

This model will take the input stimulus for the design signals and simulate what will happen in the circuit. The results of the simulation are recorded in a .vcd file (Value Change Dump), which is then fed into a waveform viewer to display the data in a human readable format. We use [Wavedrom](https://wavedrom.com/) waveform view to display the .vcd file. You can then look over the waveform and see if your circuit behaved as intended.\n",

Our testbenches also use the C++ model that was generated by Verilator, and then assert what output values should be with different inputs. \n",
