        "Verilator is an open source tool that is used in this set of notebooks. We use verilator to simulate your SystemVerilog designs. It is important to simulate hardware designs before trying to implement them fully on the hardware. Once you are running the design in hardware, things are happening so fast and all you can see is the ouputs so it is hard to know what is truly going on if there is a problem. When you simulate a hardware design, you can see what each of the signals is doing down to the nano second. To accomplish this simulation process, Verilator converts SystemVerilog (HDL) designs into a C++ model that, after compiling, can be executed. We use Veriltor in 3 main ways: linting, simulation, and test benches.\n",

This will catch syntax errors and other errors in your code before it tries to convert it to C++. When you try to simulate your SystemVerilog code and there are bugs, Verilator will print out a message to help you correct it.\n",

Once it has this model, it can take input stimulus for the signals in your design and run the C++ models to see what will happen in the circuit. It records the results of the simulation in a .vcd file (Value Change Dump). This file can be fed to waveform viewers to display the simulation in a human readable format. We use [Wavedrom](https://wavedrom.com/) waveform view to display the .vcd file. Now you can look over the waveform and see if your circuit behaved as intended.\n",

Our testbenches also use the C++ model that was generated by Verilator, and then assert what output values should be with different inputs. \n",
