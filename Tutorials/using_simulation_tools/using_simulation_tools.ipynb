        "Simulation is an important part of the hardware design process. Writing a SystemVerilog module is very different than writing a program in C++ or Python. SystemVerilog is describing a hardware configuration that you want to implement, rather than giving a list of instructions for a processor to execute. After you create a design in SystemVerilog, there a many many steps that need to be done before you can download it to an FPGA board, including synthesis, placeing and routing, and bitstream generation. These tools perform complicated analysis to optimize the the hardwre implementation of your design, and this takes time. If you make a change in your design, you don't want wait for the whole process to complete just to see if it works or not before you can move on. This is one reason why simulation is important. "

These are the signals that you will be able to stimulate to see what output is produced. All lines after the first two are essentially a list of values that you want to assign to the input signals.
