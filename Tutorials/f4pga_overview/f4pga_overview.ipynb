So F4PGA is simply a toolchain that combines opens source softwares to generate FPGA toolchains. They use different software for different steps of the process. For example, they use the [Surelog](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Surelog) parser to initial process your System Verilog code. Then they pass the design to [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/) for synthesis, and on to [nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) for place and route. If you want to learn more about F4PGA, you can look visit their [website](https://f4pga.org/). At the end of the process you will have a bitstream that you can download to your FPGA."

If you have your board on and plugged in, you can add the word `download` after `make` and it will automatically download your design to the board once the bitstream is generated.
